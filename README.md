# 📦 Compression & Decompression Algorithms Suite

A comprehensive project that demonstrates multiple **lossless text compression algorithms**, ranging from simple repetition-based methods to advanced statistical and dictionary-based techniques.

This project is designed for:

* 🎓 Learning core compression concepts
* ⚙️ Experimenting with different algorithms
* 📊 Comparing performance and efficiency

---

# 🎯 Project Overview

This repository explores how different algorithms reduce data size by:

* Eliminating redundancy
* Detecting repeated patterns
* Encoding symbols efficiently
* Leveraging statistical frequency

Each algorithm supports:

* **Compression** (Encoding)
* **Decompression** (Decoding)

---

# 🧠 Algorithms Included

## 1) Run-Length Encoding (RLE)

### 🔹 Idea

Replaces consecutive repeated characters with a single character and a count.

### 🔹 Best for

* Highly repetitive data

### 🔹 Example concept

```text
AAAABBB → A4B3
```

---

## 2) Simple Repetition Suppression (SRS)

### 🔹 Idea

Removes consecutive duplicate characters, keeping only one.

### 🔹 Example

```text
aaabbbcc → abc
```

### ⚠️ Note

* Not reversible → **not true compression**

---

## 3) LZ77 (Advanced Pattern Substitution)

### 🔹 Idea

Replaces repeated substrings with references to previous occurrences using a sliding window.

### 🔹 Format

```text
(offset, length, next_character)
```

### 🔹 Key Features

* No fixed dictionary
* Uses previously seen data dynamically
* More powerful than basic pattern substitution


### 🖼️ LZ77 Example

![alt text](./media/image.png)

The image should show:

* Sliding window
* Matching substring
* Generated tags

---

## 4) Fixed-Length Coding

### 🔹 Idea

Each symbol is assigned a binary code of equal length.

### 🔹 Example

```text
A → 00
B → 01
C → 10
D → 11
```

### 🔹 Limitation

* Does not consider frequency → inefficient

---

## 5) Variable-Length Coding

### 🔹 Idea

Assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols.

### 🔹 Key Rule

* Must be **prefix-free**

### 🔹 Benefit

* Better compression than fixed-length

---

## 6) Shannon–Fano Algorithm

### 🔹 Idea

Creates variable-length prefix-free codes by recursively splitting symbols based on frequency.

### 🔹 Steps

1. Sort symbols by frequency
2. Divide into two balanced groups
3. Assign binary digits (0 / 1)
4. Repeat recursively

---

## 7) Huffman Algorithm

### 🔹 Idea

Builds optimal prefix-free codes using a greedy approach and a binary tree.

### 🔹 Features

* Frequency-based
* Produces optimal compression
* Widely used in real-world systems

# 🔄 Compression vs Decompression

| Operation     | Description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Compression   | Converts original data into encoded form |
| Decompression | Restores original data from encoded form |
